2.      INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) - MORNING                               2.

        An old gas guzzling, dirty, white 1974 Chevy Nova BARRELS down
        a homeless-ridden street in Hollywood.  In the front seat are
        two young fellas -- one white, one black -- both wearing cheap
        black suits with thin black ties under long green dusters.
        Their names are VINCENT VEGA (white) and JULES WINNFIELD
        (black).  Jules is behind the wheel.

                                  JULES
                       -- okay now, tell me about the hash
                       bars?

                                  VINCENT
                       What so you want to know?

                                  JULES
                       Well, hash is legal there, right?

                                  VINCENT
                       Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a
                       hundred percent legal.  I mean you
                       can't walk into a restaurant, roll
                       a joint, and start puffin' away.
                       You're only supposed to smoke in
                       your home or certain designated
                       places.

                                  JULES
                       Those are hash bars?

                                  VINCENT
                       Yeah, it breaks down like this:
                       it's legal to buy it, it's legal to
                       own it and, if you're the
                       proprietor of a hash bar, it's
                       legal to sell it.  It's legal to
                       carry it, which doesn't really
                       matter 'cause -- get a load of this
                       -- if the cops stop you, it's
                       illegal for this to search you.
                       Searching you is a right that the
                       cops in Amsterdam don't have.
