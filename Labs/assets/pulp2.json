2.      INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) - MORNING                               2.

        An old gas guzzling, dirty, white 1974 Chevy Nova BARRELS down
        a homeless-ridden street in Hollywood.  In the front seat are
        two young fellas -- one white, one black -- both wearing cheap
        black suits with thin black ties under long green dusters.
        Their names are VINCENT VEGA (white) and JULES WINNFIELD
        (black).  Jules is behind the wheel.

                                  JULES
                       -- okay now, tell me about the hash
                       bars?

                                  VINCENT
                       What so you want to know?

                                  JULES
                       Well, hash is legal there, right?

                                  VINCENT
                       Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a
                       hundred percent legal.  I mean you
                       can't walk into a restaurant, roll
                       a joint, and start puffin' away.
                       You're only supposed to smoke in
                       your home or certain designated
                       places.

                                  JULES
                       Those are hash bars?

                                  VINCENT
                       Yeah, it breaks down like this:
                       it's legal to buy it, it's legal to
                       own it and, if you're the
                       proprietor of a hash bar, it's
                       legal to sell it.  It's legal to
                       carry it, which doesn't really
                       matter 'cause -- get a load of this
                       -- if the cops stop you, it's
                       illegal for this to search you.
                       Searching you is a right that the
                       cops in Amsterdam don't have.

                                  JULES
                       That did it, man -- I'm fuckin'
                       goin', that's all there is to it.

                                  VINCENT
                       You'll dig it the most.  But you
                       know what the funniest thing about
                       Europe is?

                                  JULES
                       What?

                                  VINCENT
                       It's the little differences.  A
                       lotta the same shit we got here,
                       they got there, but there they're a
                       little different.

                                  JULES
                       Examples?

                                  VINCENT
                       Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy
                       beer in a movie theatre.  And I
                       don't mean in a paper cup either.
                       They give you a glass of beer, like
                       in a bar.  In Paris, you can buy
                       beer at MacDonald's.  Also, you
                       know what they call a Quarter
                       Pounder with Cheese in Paris?

                                  JULES
                       They don't call it a Quarter
                       Pounder with Cheese?

                                  VINCENT
                       No, they got the metric system
                       there, they wouldn't know what the
                       fuck a Quarter Pounder is.

                                  JULES
                       What'd they call it?

                                  VINCENT
                       Royale with Cheese.

                                  JULES
                            (repeating)
                       Royale with Cheese.  What'd they
                       call a Big Mac?

                                  VINCENT
                       Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call
                       it Le Big Mac.

                                  JULES
                       What do they call a Whopper?

                                  VINCENT
                       I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger
                       King.  But you know what they put
                       on french fries in Holland instead
                       of ketchup?

                                  JULES
                       What?

                                  VINCENT
                       Mayonnaise.

                                  JULES
                       Goddamn!

                                  VINCENT
                       I seen 'em do it.  And I don't mean
                       a little bit on the side of the
                       plate, they fuckin' drown 'em in
                       it.

                                  JULES
                       Uuccch!
